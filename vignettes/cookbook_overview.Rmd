# Overview

This cookbook provides a step-by-step guide to running the PACTA for Banks analysis using the `{pacta.loanbook}` R package. The analysis determines alignment with climate scenarios to infer progress toward the Paris Agreement goals.

The cookbook is structured as follows:

- **[Preparatory Steps](cookbook_preparatory_steps.html)**: Prepare the loanbook, ABCD and scenario input datasets.
- **[Running the Analysis](cookbook_running_the_analysis.html)**: Match the raw loanbooks to the ABCD data and run the PACTA for Banks analysis.
- **[Interpretation of Results](cookbook_interpretation.html)**: Understand the analysis outputs.
- **[Advanced Topics](cookbook_advanced_use_cases.html)**: Guidance on advanced research questions.
- **[Metrics](cookbook_metrics.html)**: More detailed explanations and formulae of the key metrics.

## What is the PACTA for Banks analysis?

PACTA for Banks applies the PACTA methodology to assess corporate lending portfolios' alignment with climate goals. It uses forward-looking asset-based company data (ABCD) linked to financial assets to compare companies' production profiles with sector- and technology-level climate transition scenarios.

## Who are these tools built for?

The PACTA for Banks analysis is primarily designed to be run by banks on their own, with minimal additional guidance. However, it can also be a useful tool for any other user, in case they would like to run a PACTA analysis on a loan book.

## What can the results of the PACTA for Banks analysis be used for?

Banks can use the results of the analysis to assess the alignment of their loan books with the Paris Agreement goals, to identify sectors where they may need to take action to improve alignment, and to screen for potential climate-related transition risks. The results may additionally be used to identify opportunities for climate-aligned investments, as well as for detecting individual counterparties that may be exposed to climate-related transition risks and may therefore require dedicated focus in the risk management process.

Users will be able to obtain both tabular outputs and plots that can be used for any of the above use cases. The tabular output further enables processing of the alignment results in other models or tools, for example as an input into financial risk models, or as a recurring input into internal monitoring systems.

## What are the main steps of the analysis?

The main steps of the analysis are as follows:

1. Data preparation: Prepare the loan book, ABCD and Scenario input data.
2. Matching process: Match the raw loan book to the ABCD data.
3. Prioritization of loan book: Prioritize the matched loan book and analyze its coverage.
4. Run PACTA for Banks analysis: Run the analysis and generate plots.

This cookbook will guide you through each of the steps of the analysis in detail, explain the required input data sets and software, and provide guidance on how to interpret the results.
